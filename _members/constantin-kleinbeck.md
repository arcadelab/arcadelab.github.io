Constantin is a PhD student at the Friedrich-Alexander-Universität Erlangen-Nürnberg in Germany. Currently as a visiting researcher at the Arcade Lab at Johns Hopkins. Research interests include Augmented and Virtual Reality and their application in medicine, interaction design, and visualization. Currently working on interactive visualization of volumetric data and helping practitioners choose the right imaging settings via mobile Augmented Reality. Would love to pick up some AI skills while in the states.
